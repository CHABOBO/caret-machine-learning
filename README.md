# caret-machine-learning examples for practitioners
The caret machine learning package [(WIKI)](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) bundles around 200 classification and regression algorithms. Additional support for caret is given at the website [appliedpredictivemodeling.com] (http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/) and the excellent book by  Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson [ISBN: 978-1-4614-6848-6](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-6849-3). 

This R repository [https://github.com/tobigithub/caret-machine-learning/](https://github.com/tobigithub/caret-machine-learning/) collects practical working examples for many of the 200 classifications and regression models in caret and is geared towards practitioners. Example contributions from different fields are highly welcome.

Please read more in the [caret-machine-learning WIKI] (https://github.com/tobigithub/caret-machine-learning/wiki) or browse the example R code.
